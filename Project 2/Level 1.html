		<p> <br>Blue water peaceful as ice, Standing frozen as the rays of light break through the waves.</br> 
			<br>The ocean plays and tumbels, Like a child after school,</br>
			<br> But what may seem peaceful to the eye Tells andother story underneat.</br> <br>Mother Nature's untamed beast. </br><br>Fighting to be released.</br></p>
