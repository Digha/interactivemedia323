	<div><p>Those born with the Black Panther Animal Totem have a natual understanding of life's cycle.The panther is a very powerful and ancient totem. It embodies aggressiveness and power, but without the solar significance. In the case of the <u><b><a href="Mythology2.html">Black Panther</b></u></a>, there is definitely a lunar significance. The panther has over 500 voluntary muscles that they can use at will. This reflects a lot about an individual who has such animals as totems. It reflects an ability to do a variety of tasks as he or she wills.</p></div>
