		<p>As an ancient and powerful <u><b><a href="Spirit 2.html">spirit guide</b></u></a>, the panther signifies darkness, death and rebirth. This totem is the symbol of power, beauty and grace. If the panther has showed up, it invites you to befriend the night and work through your fears. Remember that from death, we are reborn.</p></div>
