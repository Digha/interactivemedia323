<p><li>Know your breeder. Pit bulls can have wonderful temperaments if they are bred for this quaily and not for fighting.
	<ul>
		<li>If the breeder tells you they train guard dogs, you may want to choose a breeder who breeds for family pets.</li>
			<li>Find out if the breeder has a reputation for selling dogs with hip dysplasia or cataracts—2 common afflictions in pit bulls.[1] Calling previous owners, reading reviews on the Internet and talking to your local animal shelters is important due diligence.</li>
		</ul>

<p><li>Keep other cats and dogs in your home. If you want your dog to socialize with animals as well as people, you should raise the puppy with those animals from the beginning.
	<ul>
		<li>If you seperate other animals form the puppy, the dog  may identify all other animals as prey and respond aggressively.</li>
	</ul>

<p><li>Buy chew toys before you bring the puppy home. Your dog wil go through teething, playing, socailzing and a lot of learning in the first few moths of ownership.
	<ul>
		<li>Toys, both soft and hard allow the dog to bite inanimate objects when teeth are growing.</li>
		<li>Failure to keep the toys stocked may result in biting behavior.</li>
	</ul>

<p><li>Dont bring a pit bull into an inactive home. Pit bulls require more exercise and play than many other breeds of dogs.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Failure to exercise dogs may make them bored, destructive and aggressive.</li>
	</ul>

<p><li> Buy a crate for your pit bull. A crate will make it easier to potty train your pit bull and help it feel at home in your house.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>The crate can also be used for transportation.</li>
		<li>If your dog is will travel frequently, you may want to use absorbent pads inside his crate. You can teach him to use the pads if he cannot go outside.</li>
		<li>When your dog is trained to use his crate, you can travel with him much more easily.</li>

<p><li>Arrange to get your puppy at 8 weeks from birth. The first 16 weeks of the puppy's life are the socialization period that determines much about what they learn about other animals and the outside world.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>The first step in socialization is ensuring the puppy had adequate time with his mother. Asker your breeder if the mom had time to care for the puppy an discipline it.</li>
		<li>The second step is socialization with littermates. Siblings teach each other about submission and dominance.</li>
			<li>The third step in socialization is the breeder. This person is the first contact with humans. A gentle touch, good discipline and basic housebreaking will go a long way.</li>
				<li>The fourth step is you as the owner. The socialization process between 7 and 16 weeks is even more important for pit bulls than other breeds of dog</li>
			</ul>

<p> <li>Wait 2 weeks to start the majority of puppy socialization. Allow the puppy to become comfortable in your home.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>You can start teaching the puppy basic commands, like “stay” and “sit” and where to pee.</li>
			<li>Pet your puppy frequently. Encourage everyone in the family and your friends to pet the puppy on the head, back and stomach.</li>
